This simple console application, which I made while learning Rust, challenges you to guess a Blue Archive student from a randomly selected School.
You may try to guess her name as many times as you want, each attempt will trigger one of the following responses:

1. This student doesn't exist
2. This student is from a different school
3. This student is shorter/the same/taller (but not the correct one) + their height
4. You guessed correctly!

It's not much, but I figured it's decent enough to be uploaded here.
